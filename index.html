                <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
                <p>I have a few hobbies that keep me busy at any given time! While I will go into more details on each of the hobbies on another page, they include basketball, hiking, traveling. I love both playing and watching basketball. My favorite professional team to watch are the Boston Celtics. As for hiking, I tend to enjoy hikes with great mountain views most. Fortunately hiking tends to work well with my passion for traveling, as I have been able to hike in many of the places I have visited.</p>

                <h2>Pets:</h2>   
                <p>Another important aspect to know about me is my passion for my dogs! I have 2 dogs (which I will have pictures of another page) named Luna and Suvi. I love playing with them, training them, and taking them with me on trips and hikes when possible. As you might know, each dog has their own personalities. As Luna is a husky, and suvi is a husky/pomeranian mix (often called a pomsky) this means they have A LOT of personality!</p>
