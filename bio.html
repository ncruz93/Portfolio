            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>Hello, here I will get a bit more in depth about myself. I grew up in Somerville, just outside of Boston for the majority of my life. As a child I grew up bilingual, speaking both English and Portuguese, with a large part of my family in Brazil. I have traveled to Brazil many times throughout my life, which probably was what fostered my love for travel. As the youngest of 4 boys, I typically had been put into many competitive activities with them. I grew up playing video games and sports with them, which led to my love for basketball. In addition, I have always had a love for animals, and find myself drawn to dogs most.</p>
            <h3>Education/Work</h3>
            <p>I completed a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology at Boston University in 2015. I then worked in the mental health field with children in hostpitals. This was both a rewarding, yet at times tiring career path. I primarily worked with children and teenagers with a conglomeration of mental health disorders, truama, or suicidal ideation. After some time, I began to feel fatigue within the field of Psychology and decided to persue a career change, which led me to computer science.</p>
