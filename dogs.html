            <p>
                This is Luna, a 3 year old husky. While thankfully she no longer destroys her bed while we are away from
                home (which to mention was hard to be mad at with how cute and innocent she was looking at me when I got
                home), she still has many husky like behaviors. She loves long walks, playing with dogs, and loves the
                snow!

            <h2>Suvi</h2>
            <p>
                Here is Suvi! Her name is short for Vesuvius, you know the mountain that destroyed pompeii about 2000
                years ago. At just about 1.5 years, she is a pomeranian husky mix (pomsky) who loves to tug just like a
                full husky. She loves running around in circles when possible, along with long walks and hikes. She also
                enjoys ripping all sorts of things, but luckly we were able to teach her to leave our furniture alone.
